/*
 * exit_group teardown reachability for internal condvar parks (issue #158)
 *
 * Copyright 2026 elfuse contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 *
 * exit_group must terminate the process even when a thread is parked on one
 * of the runtime's internal condvars, which neither the wakeup pipe nor the
 * hv_vcpus_exit kick can reach:
 *
 *   wait: the main thread blocks in wait4 on a SEIZEd tracee that never
 *         stops (parked on ptrace_cond in thread_ptrace_wait) while a worker
 *         calls exit_group. Without the teardown broadcast this deadlocks:
 *         the tracee exits without signalling ptrace_cond (only VM-clone
 *         exits do), so the main thread sleeps forever and guest_destroy is
 *         never reached. The driver timeout turns that hang into a failure.
 *
 *   stop: a tracee is held in ptrace-stop (parked on resume_cond in
 *         thread_ptrace_stop) when the tracer calls exit_group without
 *         PTRACE_CONT. Only the tracer's CONT signals resume_cond, so the
 *         tracee must be woken by the teardown broadcast to exit inside the
 *         join window instead of sleeping past the memory unmap.
 *
 *   fork: exit_group races a fork loop, so siblings are parked on the fork
 *         barrier (fork_cond in thread_fork_barrier_check) when the flag is
 *         set. Their resume normally depends on the forking thread's
 *         progress; the teardown broadcast frees them directly.
 *
 * All scenarios must exit with code 42, carried by exit_group from whichever
 * thread raced the park. PTRACE_SEIZE on a same-thread-group thread fails
 * with EPERM on real Linux (it works on elfuse, where ptrace is scoped to
 * the emulated process); the ptrace scenarios treat SEIZE failure as "park
 * cannot be constructed" and fall through to a plain exit_group(42) so the
 * expected exit code holds under differential testing.
 *
 * Syscalls: clone(220), ptrace(117), wait4(260), nanosleep(101),
 * sched_yield(124), exit(93), exit_group(94)
