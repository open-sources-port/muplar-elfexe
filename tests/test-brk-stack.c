 *
 * The heap is premapped to the mmap RX region and a grow re-maps what it
 * crosses, with the heap at 16 MiB and the stack at [120 MiB, 128 MiB). sys_brk
 * used to accept any break below guest_size, so nothing faulted on the way to
 * stop it: a grow extended page tables over whatever sat above the heap and
 * zeroed it. The symptom is a SIGSEGV or a libc "free(): invalid pointer" abort
 * in whatever ran next, well away from the allocation that caused it (issue
 * #320).
 *
 * Four neighbor shapes are covered: a mapping in the gap above the heap, one
 * starting exactly on the break, a heap chunk the guest mremapped above it, and
 * the heap grown in place across it. The last two keep the "[heap]" name. Then
 * the stack: g->stack_base is where a grow stops there, and it is the same
 * address the "[stack-guard]" record starts at, so a last check unmaps that
 * record to show the bound is the address and not the record. Linux refuses a
 * break that would run into the next mapping, so every check below passes on a
 * real kernel too.
 *
 * Calls brk(2) directly rather than through sbrk(3): musl's sbrk answers ENOMEM
 * for any non-zero increment without issuing the syscall, which would make this
 * pass without testing anything.
 *
 * Syscalls exercised: brk(214), mmap(222), mremap(216)
