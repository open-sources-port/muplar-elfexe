# elfuse Internals

This document is the canonical technical reference for the runtime. It maps the
source tree, then walks each subsystem from guest entry to syscall return:
memory layout, the EL1 shim and HVC protocol, page-table management, syscall
translation, threads, fork/clone, signals, ptrace, dynamic linking, and the
GDB stub.

It is aimed at contributors. For a high-level overview see
[../README.md](../README.md); for command-line use see [usage.md](usage.md);
for the validation flow see [testing.md](testing.md).

## Runtime Model

`elfuse` runs one Linux guest process inside one Hypervisor.framework VM owned
by one macOS host process. Guest code executes at EL0. A small EL1 shim
(`src/core/shim.S`) handles exceptions, provides the syscall trap path, and
cooperates with the host through a compact HVC protocol.

Boot sequence:

1. `src/main.c` parses options and prepares guest bootstrap state.
2. `src/core/elf.c` parses the ELF image and any `PT_INTERP` interpreter.
3. `src/core/stack.c` builds a Linux-style initial stack (`argc`, `argv`,
   `envp`, `auxv`).
4. `src/core/guest.c` reserves guest memory, page tables, and semantic
   regions.
5. `src/core/shim.S` enters guest EL0 and forwards traps through HVC exits.
6. `src/syscall/syscall.c` dispatches Linux syscalls into domain handlers.
7. `src/syscall/proc.c` owns the main vCPU run loop and stop/exit
   integration.

## Hypervisor.framework Constraints

Apple HVF imposes a handful of constraints that shape the rest of the design:

- W^X is enforced even with `SCTLR.WXN=0`. A page-table entry cannot be both
  writable and executable. Use RW for data and RX for code.
- HVF returns `SCTLR=0x0` by default; `RES1` bits must be set explicitly. The
  shim uses `SCTLR_RES1` (`0x30D00980`) plus the desired bits.
- The MMU must be enabled from inside the vCPU (via HVC #4 from the shim),
  not by the host before `hv_vcpu_run()`. Setting `SCTLR.M=1` from the host
  before vCPU entry causes permission faults on the first instruction fetch.
- `GUEST_IPA_BASE` must be `0`. ELF binaries use absolute addresses from
  their link address (e.g., `0x400000`); a non-zero IPA base produces
  translation faults.
- System registers cannot be set via `MSR` from the guest because
  `HCR_EL2.TSC=1` traps all `MSR` writes. Boot-time sysreg installation
  (RES1 bits, MMU enable, TTBR0, etc.) goes through HVC #4 from the EL1
  shim. Runtime EL0 sysreg traps -- `MSR TPIDR_EL0` and similar -- are
  handled by the HVC #12 system-instruction trap path.
- Only `HV_SYS_REG_*` constants from Hypervisor.framework may be used for
  register IDs.
- Cross-thread vCPU register access is unreliable; all register access must
  happen on the owning thread. This drives the snapshot protocol used by
  both ptrace and the GDB stub.
- HVF allows only one VM per host process. This is the reason `fork` is
  implemented through `posix_spawn` plus IPC state transfer.

## Memory Layout

Guest memory is identity-mapped (guest VA == guest IPA). Large areas use 2 MiB
block descriptors by default; mappings that need mixed permissions are split
to 4 KiB L3 pages (see [Page Table Splitting](#page-table-splitting)).

```
0x000010000  - 0x0000FFFFF:  Page table pool (960 KiB)
0x000100000  - 0x0001FFFFF:  Shim code (2 MiB block, RX)
0x000200000  - 0x0003FFFFF:  Shim data/stack (2 MiB block, RW)
0x000400000  - varies:        ELF LOAD segments (PIE_LOAD_BASE for ET_DYN)
0x001000000:                  brk base (16 MiB)
0x007800000  - 0x007800FFF:  Stack guard page (PROT_NONE, dynamic position)
0x007801000  - 0x007FFFFFF:  Stack (8 MiB, 4×2 MiB blocks, RW, grows down)
0x010000000  - 0x0101FFFFF:  mmap RX region (initial 2 MiB, pre-mapped RX)
0x010200000  - mmap_limit:    mmap RX growth area
0x200000000  - 0x2001FFFFF:  mmap RW region (initial 2 MiB at 8 GiB, RW)
0x200200000  - mmap_limit:    mmap RW growth area
interp_base  - varies:        Dynamic linker (g->interp_base, --sysroot only)
```

The guest size is determined by the VM's configured IPA width (capped at
40-bit / 1 TiB):

- 36-bit IPA (64 GiB) -- native AArch64 on Apple M2: `mmap_limit ≈ 56 GiB`,
  `interp_base ≈ 60 GiB`
- 40-bit IPA (1 TiB) -- native AArch64 on Apple M3 and later:
  `mmap_limit ≈ 1016 GiB`, `interp_base ≈ 1020 GiB`

Both `mmap_limit` and `interp_base` are computed at runtime from `guest_size`
and stored in `guest_t`. macOS demand-pages physical memory on first touch,
so the reservation costs no RAM until the guest writes to a page.

The mmap RW region starts at 8 GiB to match real Linux kernel address-space
layout, where `mmap` allocations sit well above text/data/brk.

For address spaces larger than 512 GiB, the L0 page table needs multiple
entries (each covers 512 GiB). The page-table builders compute the L0 index
from the actual IPA and allocate L1 tables on demand per L0 slot.

## Page Table Splitting

A 2 MiB L2 block descriptor cannot mix RW and RX permissions, but real shared
libraries combine `.text` (RX) and `.data` (RW) within a single 2 MiB range.
`guest_split_block()` in `src/core/guest.c` converts an L2 block descriptor
into a table descriptor pointing to an L3 table of 512 × 4 KiB page entries,
each with independent permissions.

Splitting is triggered by:

- `sys_mmap` with `MAP_FIXED`, when the fixed address lands in a block whose
  permissions differ from the request (typical case: the dynamic linker
  overlaying `.data` RW onto a library `.text` RX block).
- `sys_mprotect`, when changing permissions for a sub-block range, e.g.
  RELRO finalization.

`guest_update_perms()` orchestrates the full workflow: it checks whether a
block needs splitting, splits it if so, then updates the affected L3 page
entries. Whole-block permission changes are done in place without splitting.

`mmap` itself uses a gap-finding allocator that walks the sorted region array
to find free address space. `PROT_EXEC` requests go to the RX region
(`MMAP_RX_BASE = 0x10000000`); other requests go to the RW region
(`MMAP_BASE = 0x200000000`). Address hints are honored when possible. This
arrangement makes `.text` and `.data` land in different 2 MiB blocks where
practical, and L3 splitting handles the residual cases where they share a
block.

## Dynamic Page-Table Extension And TLBI

When `sys_mmap` or `sys_brk` needs memory beyond the currently mapped page
tables, the host calls `guest_extend_page_tables()` to add new L2 entries.
This is safe because the vCPU is paused while servicing HVC #5. After the
host modifies the tables, it sets `X8 = 1` and clears `g->need_tlbi`. The
shim inspects `X8` on return from HVC #5 and selects one of three paths:

```
X8 == 0:  no flush; restore GPRs (keep X0); ERET
X8 == 1:  TLBI VMALLE1IS; DSB ISH; IC IALLU; DSB ISH; ISB
          → restore GPRs (keep X0); ERET
X8 == 2:  TLBI VMALLE1IS; DSB ISH; ISB; IC IALLU; DSB ISH; ISB
          → discard the saved GPR frame (`add sp, sp, #256`) and ERET
          on the rebuilt EL0 register state
```

`X8 == 1` is taken when page-table permissions or layout changed but the
syscall return values still flow through the normal SVC ABI (writes still
preserve `X1`–`X30`, including the syscall number register, which Linux
already considers clobbered).

`X8 == 2` is the `execve` / `rt_sigreturn` path: the host wrote a fresh
register state directly into the vCPU and the old saved frame on the EL1
stack is stale. The shim drops the frame and `ERET`s without restoring
GPRs. `IC IALLU` is required because the new program text may live in the
same physical pages that previously held the old text.

`X8` (the syscall-number register) is already considered clobbered by the
Linux syscall ABI, so callers never expect it to be preserved across SVC.

Important: `sys_execve` and `sys_rt_sigreturn` return `SYSCALL_EXEC_HAPPENED`,
which bypasses the normal syscall dispatch epilogue. They therefore write
`X8 = 2` directly via `hv_vcpu_set_reg()`. Any future code path that
returns `SYSCALL_EXEC_HAPPENED` and rebuilds the EL0 register state must do
the same.

## EL1 Shim And HVC Protocol

Vectors enter EL1 from EL0 traps and forward them to the host through HVC.
DC ZVA is emulated inside the shim (it zeroes 64 bytes at the cache-line-
aligned address from the `Rt` register); HVF traps DC ZVA via `HCR_EL2.TDZ=1`.

| HVC # | Purpose | Registers |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| #0 | Normal exit | `X0` = exit code |
| #2 | Bad exception | `X0`=ESR, `X1`=FAR, `X2`=ELR, `X3`=SPSR, `X5`=vector |
| #4 | Set boot system register | `X0` = reg ID (0–8), `X1` = value (used by the shim during boot to install RES1 bits and enable the MMU) |
| #5 | Syscall forward | `X0`–`X5` = args, `X8` = syscall number on entry; on return `X8` is the post-syscall flag (`0` = none, `1` = TLBI required, `2` = `execve`/`rt_sigreturn` rebuilt the register frame) |
| #7 | MRS trap (read sysreg) | host reads register from ESR ISS; returns value in `X0` |
| #9 | W^X toggle | `X0` = FAR, `X1` = type (0 = exec→RX, 1 = write→RW) |
| #10 | BRK from EL0 | SIGTRAP delivery / ptrace-stop; GPRs in frame |
| #11 | EL0 fault | SIGSEGV/SIGILL delivery; GPRs in frame |
| #12 | EL0 system-instruction trap | cache maintenance logging (DC CVAU, IC IVAU, …) and `MSR TPIDR_EL0` emulation |

### Critical Vector-Entry Rule

Vector entry stubs that lead to `svc_handler` MUST NOT clobber any GPR. The
Linux syscall ABI preserves all registers except `X0` across `SVC #0`, and
musl/glibc rely on this for scratch registers (`X9`–`X15`). If a vector entry
writes to any GPR (e.g., `mov x5, #offset`) before `svc_handler` saves
registers, the saved value is wrong and the EL0 caller's register state is
corrupted after `ERET`.

Only `bad_exception` vectors may clobber `X5` (they halt, so preservation is
unnecessary).

## Syscall Translation Boundary

Linux user-space compatibility comes from explicit translation at the syscall
boundary. `src/syscall/syscall.c` routes syscall numbers into focused domain
files. The translation layer is responsible for:

- errno translation
- flag translation
- Linux/macOS structure layout adaptation
- guest memory copying for pointer arguments
- Linux-compatible descriptor and signal semantics

### errno

macOS and Linux errno values diverge starting around 35. `linux_errno()` in
`src/syscall/translate.c` maps via switch. Notable mappings:

| Linux | macOS |
|-------|-------|
| `EAGAIN` (11) | `EAGAIN` (35) |
| `ENOSYS` (38) | `ENOSYS` (78) |
| `ENAMETOOLONG` (36) | `ENAMETOOLONG` (63) |
| `ELOOP` (40) | `ELOOP` (62) |

### `AT_*` Flags

`AT_*` flag bits differ between Linux and macOS:

| Flag | Linux | macOS |
|------|-------|-------|
| `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` | `0x100` | `0x20` |
| `AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW` | `0x400` | `0x40` |
| `AT_REMOVEDIR` | `0x200` | `0x80` |

Most `AT_*` flags go through `translate_at_flags()` in
`src/syscall/translate.c` before issuing macOS calls. `faccessat` is a
special case: Linux defines `AT_EACCESS` at the same bit (`0x200`) as
`AT_REMOVEDIR`, so `faccessat` paths instead use
`translate_faccessat_flags()` (also in `src/syscall/translate.c`), which
interprets that bit as `AT_EACCESS`.

### `open` Flag Values

Aarch64-Linux open flags differ from x86_64. From `asm-generic/fcntl.h`:

| Flag | Value (octal) | Value (hex) |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `O_DIRECTORY` | `040000` | `0x4000` |
| `O_NOFOLLOW`  | `0100000` | `0x8000` |
| `O_DIRECT`    | `0200000` | `0x10000` |
| `O_LARGEFILE` | `0400000` | `0x20000` (no-op on LP64) |
| `O_CLOEXEC`   | `02000000` | `0x80000` |

### Clock IDs

Linux `CLOCK_MONOTONIC = 1`, macOS `CLOCK_MONOTONIC = 6`. See
`translate_clockid()` in `src/syscall/time.c`. Other clock IDs are
translated similarly.

### Sockets

Socket syscalls are translated in `src/syscall/net.c` and friends:

- `AF_INET6` differs: Linux `10`, macOS `30`.
- `sockaddr` has no `sa_len` byte on Linux but does on macOS. All conversions
  go through `linux_to_mac_sockaddr()` and `mac_to_linux_sockaddr()`.
- Linux ORs `SOCK_NONBLOCK` (`0x800`) and `SOCK_CLOEXEC` (`0x80000`) into the
  type argument; both bits must be extracted before calling `socket()`.
- `SOL_SOCKET` option numbers (`SO_TYPE`, `SO_SNDBUF`, `SO_RCVBUF`, …)
  differ between platforms and are remapped per option.

### Stack Alignment

The Linux initial stack must have `SP` 16-byte aligned and pointing directly
at `argc`. Total 8-byte words on the structured area are
`35 + extra + argc + envc`, where:

- `35` covers the always-present pieces: 15 base auxv entries, the
  always-present `AT_EXECFN` and `AT_BASE` (`+4`), the auxv `AT_NULL`
  terminator (`+2`), the `envp` and `argv` `NULL` terminators (`+2`), and
  `argc` itself (`+1`). The base 15 auxv entries pack into `15 × 2 = 30`
  words; combined with the four extras above, that totals `35`.
- `extra` adds `2` for `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR` if a vDSO is present and another
  `2` for `AT_EXECFD` when `binfmt_misc` passes one.
- `argc` and `envc` are the user-provided argument and environment counts.

If that total is odd, one padding word is pushed before `auxv`. Padding
goes above the structured area, never below. Post-push masking
(`sp &= ~15`) breaks because it inserts a gap between `SP` and `argc`. See
`build_linux_stack()` in `src/core/stack.c` for the full layout.

### `mmap` Notes

`MAP_SHARED` is treated as `MAP_PRIVATE` (copy-on-write). The guest is a
single process, so shared and private semantics are equivalent here. This
also enables tools like `sort` that expect file-backed shared mappings on
large inputs.

`MAP_FIXED` file-backed `mmap` must `pread()` file contents into guest
memory. Both the `MAP_FIXED` and non-fixed paths need this. The `MAP_FIXED`
path zeros the region first (for pages beyond EOF), then overlays file
content.

## Threads And Futexes

Guest threads map 1:1 to host pthreads. Each guest thread owns one vCPU and
shares the same guest address space. HVF supports multiple vCPUs per VM,
each bound to the host thread that created it; multiple vCPUs share guest
physical memory via `hv_vm_map()`. Up to `MAX_THREADS = 64` guest threads
are supported per VM.

### Thread Table

`src/runtime/thread.c` and `thread.h`:

- `thread_entry_t` per thread holds the vCPU handle, host pthread, per-thread
  signal mask, `clear_child_tid` (for `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID`), and the
  thread's `SP_EL1` exception stack.
- `_Thread_local current_thread` gives O(1) access from syscall handlers.
- Each thread receives a 4 KiB EL1 exception stack carved out of the shim
  data region.

### Futex

`src/runtime/futex.c` implements:

- The classic ops: `FUTEX_WAIT`, `FUTEX_WAKE`, `FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET`,
  `FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET`, `FUTEX_REQUEUE`, `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE`, `FUTEX_WAKE_OP`.
- A subset of priority-inheritance ops: `FUTEX_LOCK_PI`, `FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI`,
  `FUTEX_TRYLOCK_PI`. Priority semantics are not actually inherited -- the
  ops behave as ordinary mutex acquire/release, which is enough for glibc
  and musl to make forward progress.
- `futex_waitv` (syscall 449) for batch waits across up to 128 futex
  addresses.
- Robust-list cleanup: `set_robust_list` / `get_robust_list` are wired up
  in `src/syscall/syscall.c`, and `robust_list_walk()` releases owned
  futexes on thread exit, marking them `FUTEX_OWNER_DIED`.

Wait queues live in a hash table keyed by guest virtual address, with a
per-bucket mutex. Each waiter has its own condition variable for precise
wakeup. Thread exit calls `futex_wake_one()` on `clear_child_tid`, which is
how `pthread_join()` waits via the TID address.

Atomicity: the bucket mutex is held across the futex word read and the
waiter enqueue, so the compare-and-wait is a single critical section.

### Lock Map

| Resource | Lock | File |
|----------|------|------|
| `mmap`/`brk` allocators + page tables | `mmap_lock` | `src/syscall/mem.c` |
| FD table | `fd_lock` | `src/syscall/fdtable.c` |
| Thread table | `pthread_mutex` | `src/runtime/thread.c` |
| Futex wait queues | `pthread_mutex` (per bucket) | `src/runtime/futex.c` |

Lock ordering is documented inline in those files (`mmap_lock` is order 1,
`fd_lock` is order 3) so callers that need multiple locks acquire them in
the right sequence.

Page-table consistency is preserved by the `mmap_lock` plus TLB broadcasts
via `TLBI VMALLE1IS` from any vCPU; hardware coherency is verified by
`tests/test-multi-vcpu`.

### Thread Group Exit

`exit_group` sets a global `exit_group_requested` flag, calls
`thread_for_each(thread_force_exit_cb)` which invokes `hv_vcpus_exit()` on
all worker vCPUs to break them out of `hv_vcpu_run()`, and joins worker
threads with a timeout so `CLEARTID` cleanup can complete.

### Not Implemented

- True priority inheritance for the PI futex ops. The ops are wired up but
  behave as ordinary mutexes; this matches what glibc and musl need for
  forward progress, not real RT scheduling.
- CPU affinity (`sched_setaffinity`) returns the all-CPUs mask.

## Fork, Clone, And `execve`

macOS HVF allows only one VM per process, so process-style `fork` cannot
clone the live VM. `elfuse` implements it through `posix_spawn` plus IPC
state transfer:

1. Parent creates a `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)`.
2. Parent `posix_spawn`s a new `elfuse --fork-child <fd>` process.
3. Parent serializes VM state over IPC (see paths below).
4. Child receives state, creates its own VM, restores registers directly
   into EL0 (bypassing the shim `_start` so callee-saved GPRs survive), and
   enters the vCPU loop with `X0 = 0` (the child return from `clone`).
5. Parent records the child in the process table and returns the child PID.

### CoW Fork Path (IPC v4)

When `g->shm_fd >= 0` the guest memory is file-backed (`mkstemp` + `unlink`,
`MAP_SHARED`). Fork sends the backing fd over `SCM_RIGHTS`:

- Parent stays on `MAP_SHARED` and does NOT remap -- HVF caches the host
  VA→PA mapping from `hv_vm_map`, and a `MAP_FIXED` remap does not update
  Stage-2, so a remapping parent would observe stale pages.
- Child maps the fd `MAP_PRIVATE`, producing an instant CoW clone with zero
  data copy.
- The IPC header sets `has_shm = 1` and `num_regions = 0`, skipping memory
  serialization entirely.
- Child calls `guest_init_from_shm()` instead of `guest_init()`, and must
  restore `g->ttbr0` from the IPC header -- `guest_init_from_shm` zeroes the
  struct, and without `ttbr0` page-table walks fail for all high VAs.

This path is roughly 50× faster than the legacy IPC copy path on large guest
memories.

macOS rejects `MAP_PRIVATE` on `shm_open` fds (`EINVAL`), so the backing
file is created via `mkstemp` + `unlink`.

### Legacy IPC Copy Path

When `g->shm_fd < 0`, the parent serializes used memory regions in 1 MiB
chunks over the socket pair, the child calls `guest_init()` and receives the
data into fresh guest memory. CLOEXEC semantics follow POSIX: all FDs
(including those marked CLOEXEC) are inherited across `fork`. CLOEXEC takes
effect at `execve` (see `src/syscall/exec.c` step 4).

### `clone(CLONE_VM)`

`sys_clone_vm()` in `src/runtime/forkipc.c` handles `CLONE_VM` without
`CLONE_THREAD`. Unlike `sys_clone_thread()`, VM-clone children are waitable
via `wait4` and have exit semantics (`exit_signal`, `vm_exit_status`).
Unlike the `posix_spawn` fork path, they share the same `guest_t*`, the
same guest memory, and the same page tables.

### `clone(CLONE_THREAD)`

In `src/runtime/forkipc.c`:

1. `hv_vcpu_create()` and per-thread `SP_EL1` allocation.
2. Set the child SP, `TPIDR_EL0` (TLS), and copy the parent's signal mask.
3. `pthread_create()` running `vcpu_run_loop()` for the child vCPU.
4. Return the child TID to the parent; the child runs with `X0 = 0`.

### `execve`

`sys_execve` in `src/syscall/exec.c` reloads the ELF, loads the dynamic
interpreter for dynamically-linked targets via the shared
`elf_resolve_interp()` helper (also used at startup), rebuilds page tables,
and restarts the vCPU. Signal handlers are reset to `SIG_DFL` per POSIX:
`SIG_IGN` stays `SIG_IGN`, and pending and blocked masks are preserved.
This happens in `signal_reset_for_exec()` after `guest_reset`.

## Signals

Signals are fully implemented in `src/syscall/signal.c`. The signal frame
matches Linux `arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:setup_rt_frame()` so the C
library's `__restore_rt → rt_sigreturn` (syscall 139) restores state
correctly. Both musl and glibc use this mechanism.

Key points:

- `signal_deliver()` builds `linux_rt_sigframe_t` on the guest stack,
  redirects the vCPU PC to the handler, and sets `X0 = signum`,
  `X30 = sa_restorer`.
- `signal_rt_sigreturn()` restores all 31 GPRs, `SP`, `PC`, and `PSTATE`
  from the frame.
- SIGPIPE is queued automatically when `write`, `writev`, or `pwrite64`
  returns `EPIPE`.
- Guest `ITIMER_REAL` is emulated internally rather than being forwarded to
  host `setitimer`, because macOS shares `alarm()` and
  `setitimer(ITIMER_REAL)` as a single timer, and `elfuse` already needs
  `alarm()` for its per-iteration vCPU watchdog.
- `signal_check_timer()` is called from the vCPU loop after each syscall.
- After `SYSCALL_EXEC_HAPPENED`, the vCPU loop verifies that `ELR_EL1` is
  non-zero -- a defensive check against HVF register-sync bugs.
- Each `thread_entry_t` carries its own `blocked` mask. `rt_sigprocmask`
  operates on `current_thread->blocked`, and child threads inherit the
  parent's mask at clone time.

## Ptrace And `clone(CLONE_VM)` Tracing

`clone(CLONE_VM)` produces an inferior that shares guest memory; the tracer
attaches via `PTRACE_SEIZE`. `BRK` instructions trigger ptrace-stops, after
which the tracer reads and writes registers through the snapshot protocol.

### Operations

In `src/syscall/proc.c`:

- `PTRACE_SEIZE` -- attach without stopping; sets `ptraced = 1`.
- `PTRACE_CONT` -- resume the stopped tracee, optionally injecting a signal.
- `PTRACE_INTERRUPT` -- force the tracee into ptrace-stop via
  `hv_vcpus_exit()`.
- `PTRACE_GETREGSET` / `PTRACE_SETREGSET` (`NT_PRSTATUS`) -- read or write
  the tracee's register snapshot. Writes are applied on resume.

### Snapshot Protocol

Cross-thread HVF register access is unreliable, so every actor uses a
snapshot:

1. Tracee snapshots its own vCPU registers into `ptrace_regs` before
   entering ptrace-stop.
2. `ptrace_stopped = 1` and the tracer is signaled via `ptrace_cond`.
3. Tracer reads and writes the snapshot via `GETREGSET` / `SETREGSET`.
4. Tracer issues `PTRACE_CONT`; the tracee clears `ptrace_stopped` and is
   signaled via `resume_cond`.
5. Tracee applies any dirty register changes back to the vCPU and resumes.

### `BRK` Flow

1. Guest executes `BRK` → shim forwards via HVC #10.
2. If `current_thread->ptraced`, the tracee calls
   `thread_ptrace_stop(SIGTRAP)`.
3. Snapshot, broadcast, wait, resume as above.
4. `wait4` returns `WIFSTOPPED(status)` with `WSTOPSIG == SIGTRAP` to the
   tracer.

### `wait4` Integration

`sys_wait4()` first checks for ptraced or VM-clone children via
`thread_ptrace_wait()` before falling through to the process table for
regular `fork` children, so ptrace-stops and VM-exit states are reported
without racing the regular wait path.

## procfs And Device Emulation

`src/runtime/procemu.c` intercepts a focused set of guest-visible paths
under `/proc`, `/dev`, and a few Linux-expected compatibility files:

- Many procfs files are synthesized from host-side runtime state.
- `/proc/self/*` is backed by internal region, FD-table, and process data.
- Synthetic proc directories support common traversal patterns used by
  BusyBox `ps`, `uptime`, and `top`.
- Guest cwd handling preserves a virtual `/proc` working directory even
  though the host operates on synthetic backing directories.

Related implementation: `src/runtime/procemu.c`, `src/syscall/path.c`,
`src/syscall/fs.c`, `src/syscall/proc_state.c`.

## Dynamic Linking

`elfuse` supports dynamically linked aarch64-linux ELF binaries via
`--sysroot`:

```sh
elfuse --sysroot /path/to/sysroot ./my-dynamic-program
```

How it works:

1. `elf_load()` parses `PT_INTERP` to find the interpreter path
   (`/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` for glibc, `/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` for
   musl).
2. The interpreter is loaded as `ET_DYN` at `g->interp_base` (computed
   dynamically: 60 GiB for 36-bit IPA, 1020 GiB for 40-bit IPA).
3. `build_linux_stack()` passes `AT_BASE` (interpreter load address) and
   `AT_EXECFN` (`argv[0]`) in the auxiliary vector.
4. The entry point becomes `interp_entry + load_base`; the dynamic linker
   takes over from there.
5. `sys_openat()` redirects guest absolute paths through the sysroot: if
   `--sysroot` is set, it tries `<sysroot>/<path>` first.

The sysroot is inherited by fork children via IPC state transfer.
`sys_execve` also loads the interpreter for dynamically linked targets, so
tools that `execve` dynamic children (`env`, `nice`, `nohup`) work
correctly. `elf_resolve_interp()` in `src/core/elf.c` is shared between
`src/main.c` and `src/syscall/exec.c`.

### Known Limitations

None currently tracked for the aarch64-linux dynamic-linker path.

## GDB Stub

`src/debug/` is split by role:

- `gdbstub.c` -- session lifecycle, stop/resume flow, packet dispatch
- `gdbstub-rsp.c` -- RSP packet transport and hex helpers
- `gdbstub-reg.c` -- register snapshot layout, restore flow, `target.xml`

The stub runs in all-stop mode. Because Hypervisor.framework register access
must happen on the owning thread, the stopped vCPU snapshots its own state;
the GDB-handler thread reads and updates the snapshot, and the owning thread
restores the modified state on resume -- the same pattern used by ptrace.

The split mirrors the architectural boundary: transport and encoding are
independent of guest execution; register layout is independent of socket I/O;
stop/resume sequencing remains tightly coupled to process and thread state.

## Testing And Confidence

`elfuse` uses several layers of validation:

- `make check` -- fast guest tests plus the BusyBox applet smoke suite.
- `make test-busybox` -- applet coverage in isolation.
- `make test-gdbstub` -- debugger integration.
- `make test-matrix` -- cross-checks elfuse against QEMU on the same corpus.

The rule for contributors is simple: match the validation depth to the
subsystem you changed. Procfs, process state, dynamic linking, and debugging
typically warrant more than `make check`. See [testing.md](testing.md) for
the full target list and the validation-by-change-type table.
