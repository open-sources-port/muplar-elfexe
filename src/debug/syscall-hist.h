 * Per-syscall count + total + max latency, captured during the EL0 syscall
 * storm that dominates dynamic-linker bring-up. Opt-in via
 * ELFUSE_STARTUP_TRACE=syscalls (or =all alongside the existing per-step VM
 * bring-up tracer). Recording stops at the first successful execve so the
 * dump reflects pre-execve startup; without execve it dumps on guest exit.
 *
 * Disabled cost is one branch + one global load per syscall_dispatch entry
 * because syscall_hist_enabled() resolves the env once and caches the
 * result. Enabled cost is two CLOCK_MONOTONIC reads per syscall plus three
 * relaxed atomic adds.
