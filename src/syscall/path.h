/* Returns 1 if resolving path against dirfd would cross a mount boundary from

 * guest filesystem, /proc, /dev, /sys, /tmp, /dev/shm, and each live or
 * tombstoned FUSE mount (keyed by mount_id). The walker classifies every
 * intermediate prefix as it advances, so transient excursions through /proc
 * that lexically resolve back into the root class still surface as a crossing.
 * Symlink components are expanded inline against the host-walk fd when possible
 * so a link whose target lives in a different class is caught at the precheck.
 *
 * When out_start_class is non-NULL it is populated with the dirfd's mount class
 * on every non-error return so the caller can re-run the check against the
 * actually opened fd via path_openat2_check_fd_xdev. The post-open check is
 * what closes the symlink bypass for callers that do not also set
 * RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS: the precheck's fstatat walk cannot see symlinks that
 * live in a sidecar shadow directory (case-fold sysroot), so the kernel may
 * follow a link the walker did not, and only F_GETPATH on the resulting fd
 * reveals the real landing site.
 *
 * Known gaps (best-effort by design):
 * - host_path_to_guest_path strips the configured sysroot prefix with
 *    a case-sensitive strncmp; on case-insensitive macOS volumes a
 *    differently-cased F_GETPATH could fail to strip and the dirfd is
 *    then classified as the root class. Sysroots that happen to live
 *    under /proc, /dev, or /sys on the host are not supported.
 * - A sibling vCPU that chdir(2)s, dup3(2)s over dirfd, or mounts /
 *    unmounts a FUSE filesystem between this check and the subsequent
 *    sys_openat may shift the resolution into a different mount class
 *    without the cross being detected. The race window is narrow and
 *    the guest is in elfuse's trust domain.
